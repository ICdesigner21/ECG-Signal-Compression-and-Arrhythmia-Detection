# ECG-Signal-Compression-and-Arrhythmia-Detection

This project contains arrhythmia detection and compression of the ECG signal.

Firstly, arrhythmia detection was performed, then compression of the ECG signal was accomplished. Signal procesisng part of arrhythmia detection was finished in MATLAB and detection was done in Python using Jupyter Notebook. After detection arrhythmia, the ECG signal was compressed in MATLAB. A button has been created for your convenience, which holds all files for this porject, such as code files (written in mathwork). Just press the button and go to online MATLAB. Start MATLAB in a second.
